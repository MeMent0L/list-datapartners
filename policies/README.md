# "Pledged" Label

Here is the process to get a "Pledged" label.

1. Link your Ethereum address to your email account. [See directions below.](#link-email-account)
2. Send an email to us, from your company / organization account, using the pledge text given below.
3. We will reply by email, saying "Please confirm you have received this".
4. You will reply by email, saying "I confirm".

If it is detected that you broke the Pledge, the "Pledged" label will be removed, and your account will go into Purgatory. Steps 3 and 4 are to counter email spoofing.

**"Pledged" text** (you need to fill in the blanks):
```
<from: [Your Email] ____________>
<to: marketrequest@oceanprotocol.com>
<subject: Pledge Request>

I would like to add "Pledged" status to my account.

To users of Ocean Market, I pledge...
1. To publish useful data to the best of my ability
2. To publish only data that I have the IP rights to, which is not
   considered sensitive data (personally identifiable information, etc).
3. To not withdraw >1% of my share of the pool liquidity per week,
   sell >1% of my datatokens in the pool per week, or any other behavior
   that would similarly hurt other datatoken stakers or investors
4. To do actions that follow the spirit of the pledge.

I understand that if I break this pledge, my account will be put into Purgatory.

Signed,
[Your Account]  0x___________________

# "Data Launch Partner" Label

Here is the process to get a "Data Launch Partner" label.

1. Be there at launch, which was in October 2020. The [data launch partner list](list-accounts-data-launch-partner.json) is here; if you're on the list, you have the label. The list is not growing.

It is likely we will retire this list over time.
